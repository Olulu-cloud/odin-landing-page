# Odin Landing Page Project

This project is the second assignment in The Odin Project's Full Stack curriculum. It focuses on demonstrating fundamental web development skills.

Skills I will have demonstrated upon completion:
*   Setting up a GitHub repository and cloning it locally.
*   Creating a basic HTML structure using boilerplate and semantic tags.
*   Adding content, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
*   Committing changes to a local Git repository and pushing them to a remote GitHub repository.
*   (Later, this list will include CSS styling concepts like Flexbox)
